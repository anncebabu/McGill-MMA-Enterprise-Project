 # Supply Chain Demand Forecasting Using Machine Learning

 This project aims to develop a robust supply chain demand forecasting model to enhance decision-making. Using a dataset from Mendeley Data, we utilized machine learning techniques to predict demand accurately.

Key highlights include:

* Algorithms Used: Random Forest and XGBoost for predictive modeling.

* Tooling: Built an end-to-end pipeline using DVC for data versioning and Streamlit for deployment.

* Development Environment: Implemented in Python, using VS Code as the primary IDE.

* Teamwork: Collaborated effectively as part of a group to ensure quality and efficiency.
